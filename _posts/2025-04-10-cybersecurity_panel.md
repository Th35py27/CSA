# What is Cybersecurity
- Cybersecurity is the idea of protecting data, systems, and software from unauthorized access or attacks.
- Without proper cybersecurity, private information can be exposed, and companies can suffer major financial losses.
- There are a lot of jobs in this field, such as ethical hackers, who use their knowledge of hacking to help defend against real attacks.
- It's an essential field because many people aren't aware of cyber threats like phishing or ransomware, making them vulnerable.

# Guest Speakers

## David Tomasz
- David Tomasz worked for the FBI and has years of experience tracking down hackers.
- He spent over 3 years following one hacker and was deeply involved in hunting ransomware threats.
- His role focused on identifying and stopping various cyber attacks.

## Dr. Victor Nzeata
- Dr. Victor Nzeata is a cybersecurity expert and professor at USD.
- He worked on a project involving PowerShell scripting to detect lingering data left behind by veterans in old systems.
- His work highlights how deep data traces can remain in systems and how to uncover them.

## Tricia Mercer
- Tricia Mercer shared a recent case where a senior leader at a company faced financial problems and had to take leave.
- Despite stepping down, this individual still had access to company data and started stealing it.
- Her story emphasized the importance of access control and regular review of who has data permissions.

# Information Learned
- Ransomware continues to be a major issue, costing businesses billions of dollars globally.
- AI can also be used as a weapon in cyber attacks, making it a growing concern for security professionals.
- Many people still lack basic cybersecurity awareness, including recognizing phishing scams.
- Ethical hackers are trained to think like attackers and use that knowledge to defend systems and discover weaknesses.
- A “backdoor” is an insecure and unintended way to access a system—it should never exist in a secure software environment.
- “Zero day” refers to vulnerabilities that are unknown to software developers and have no current fix. These can be exploited by attackers before companies can respond.
- Sometimes, automatic updates (like from Microsoft Cloud) can unintentionally introduce vulnerabilities—these are also considered “zero day” risks if they go unnoticed.

# Future of Cybersecurity
- In the next 5–10 years, cybersecurity will become more specialized, with different branches depending on the industry (e.g., health IT, business IT).
- Threats will continue to grow in complexity and number, meaning constant development and learning will be needed.
- Having a background in IT is becoming more important for entering the cybersecurity field.
- More importantly, being ethical and having a strong moral compass is key—cybersecurity professionals must use their skills for good.
- Cybersecurity is a field with endless skills to learn and will always be in demand as technology evolves.
