# Reflection
- Over the last 12 weeks, I have worked on 3 different projects and have showcased my skills in Java and JS working on a full stack development with Torin and Dylan and my contributions have incldued implementing assignments into calendar feature, implementing SAGAI into the Combined Backend and Frontend, and worked on Forum, a project which includes people to ask questions and comment to class related topics. I built this feature to instill and include more communication and activity in class, while showcasing my skills in frontend and backend.

- Over the trimester I improved my communication skills and worked with Torin, whom I've been working on coding projects for the last 2 years, doing work in CSP as well. We worked on Forum, he worked on improving and implementing top blogs within nighthawk coding society while I worked on something similar to Github Issues which allows users to comment and create issues. For me, communication with Bella helped me implement my feature better within the deployed section and Bella helped fix any issues I was facing on the Forum Branch. Torin helped me as a team member to get work done, and Dylan helped debug any issues I was facing on my repo. Overall, having good communication with my team allowed me to do better throughout the trimester and also ecncouraged me to think outside the box and pursue further. 

# Future Plans
- I plan on adding analytics to my project and possibly adding more user features that give the home page more functionality. One thing I was planning on getting to but didn't do was adding a machine learning algorithm that recommends blogs and similar issues based on what the user saw, so working with data the user already has seen.
