# What I learnt

- Liked taking things apart and learnt engineering that way
- Lot of them worked with problem based learning (PBL) and realized their interests that way 

- Worked in many internships during their time in high school and college and worked with planning and incorporating their presentational skills with their PBL and STEM related learning 
- Used flowcharts to plan out programs and methodology related to coding in college, but got a lot of practice in the computer science classes
- Did similar things to live reviews and presentations in a computer science club 
- Did a hackathon which dealt with code that was similar to stuff in Mr.Mort’s classes regarding frontend and backend programming
- Used flowcharts to do the Dijkstra algorithm in engineering class
- Internships and jobs cared more about the skills you’ve gained rather than the college GPA
- Learned most of web creation knowledge in CSP, where they gained more skills of Python and JS
- Talked about research and contacting professors related to what they want to do
