# MCQ Corrections 

- Q5: Which of the following always evaluates to the same value as the expression?

What I chose: D
Right Answer: A


Reasoning: No matter what y is, the expression will always evaluate to just if x was equal to true or false. 
- Example: If x is true and y is false, then the (x ||y) will evaluate to true, and the x is true, which because of the && statement will lead it true. If x is true as per the scenario given, then it evaluates to just x. 


- Q6: Which of the following method calls demonstrates that the method does not work as intended?

What I chose: D
Right Answer: A

Reasoning: The word art will not be able to be determined, since it is present across 2 different words rather than being present in just one word. I have made a mistake in this
