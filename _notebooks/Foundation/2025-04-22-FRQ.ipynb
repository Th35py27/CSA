    "## 1. Methods and Control Structures\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "This type of question focuses on writing a method that performs a specific task. It tests your understanding of:\n",
    "- Loops (`for`, `while`)\n",
    "- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`)\n",
    "- Basic algorithm implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Look Out For:\n",
    "- **Input and Output**: Ensure you understand the method signature and what inputs/outputs are expected.\n",
    "- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases like empty arrays, null values, or boundary conditions.\n",
    "- **Control Flow**: Use loops and conditionals effectively to solve the problem.\n",
    "- **Return Statement**: Ensure the method returns the correct value or performs the required action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Write a method that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Class Design\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "This question tests your ability to design and implement a class. It often involves:\n",
    "- Writing constructors\n",
    "- Defining instance variables\n",
    "- Implementing methods (getters, setters, or custom methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Look Out For:\n",
    "- **Instance Variables**: Ensure proper encapsulation (use `private`).\n",
    "- **Constructors**: Initialize all instance variables correctly.\n",
    "- **Method Implementation**: Follow the method specifications exactly.\n",
    "- **Access Modifiers**: Use `public` and `private` appropriately.\n",
    "- **toString() Method**: If required, implement a `toString()` method to return a string representation of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Design a `Book` class with instance variables for title, author, and price. Include methods to get and set these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Array/ArrayList\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "This type of question focuses on manipulating arrays or `ArrayList` objects. It tests your ability to:\n",
    "- Traverse arrays or lists\n",
    "- Add, remove, or modify elements\n",
    "- Perform operations like searching or sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Look Out For:\n",
    "- **Indexing**: Be careful with array or list indices to avoid `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n",
    "- **Iteration**: Use enhanced `for` loops or standard `for` loops as appropriate.\n",
    "- **Mutability**: Remember that `ArrayList` allows dynamic resizing, while arrays have fixed sizes.\n",
    "- **Edge Cases**: Handle empty arrays/lists or cases where elements are not found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Write a method that takes an `ArrayList` of integers and removes all negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. 2D Array\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "This question involves working with two-dimensional arrays. It tests your ability to:\n",
    "- Traverse rows and columns\n",
    "- Perform operations on specific rows, columns, or elements\n",
    "- Implement algorithms like searching or summing elements\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Look Out For:\n",
    "- **Nested Loops**: Use nested loops to traverse rows and columns.\n",
    "- **Row and Column Bounds**: Ensure you donâ€™t exceed the array dimensions.\n",
    "- **Edge Cases**: Handle empty arrays or arrays with irregular dimensions.\n",
    "- **Row vs. Column Order**: Pay attention to whether the question asks for row-wise or column-wise operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Write a method that takes a 2D array of integers and returns the sum of all elements in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Tips for All FRQs:\n",
    "1. **Read the Question Carefully**:\n",
    "   - Pay attention to method signatures, return types, and parameter requirements.\n",
    "   - Look for specific instructions like \"must use a loop\" or \"do not use additional data structures.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Plan Before Coding**:\n",
    "   - Write comments or pseudocode to outline your approach before diving into the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Follow Java Conventions**:\n",
    "   - Use proper naming conventions for variables and methods.\n",
    "   - Avoid hardcoding values unless explicitly required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check for Errors**:\n",
    "   - Test your code mentally with sample inputs.\n",
    "   - Ensure all edge cases are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Time Management**:\n",
    "   - Allocate time wisely. If stuck, move on to the next question and return later."
